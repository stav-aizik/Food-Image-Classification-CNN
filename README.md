# Food-Image-Classification-CNN
A deep learning model for classifying food images into 10 categories using TensorFlow and Keras, with preprocessing, data augmentation, and CNN architecture for optimized performance.


This project implements a deep learning pipeline for multi-class food image classification. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized with data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, shifting, and zooming, to improve accuracy and generalization. The workflow includes image preprocessing, dataset organization, model training, validation, and performance evaluation. The result is a model capable of classifying images into ten distinct food categories with high accuracy, demonstrating practical applications of computer vision in food recognition and AI-driven culinary solutions.
